							<p class="align-left">Hello, ladies and gentlemen, get ready to shine!  Welcome to Danceternal Studio, where you can enjoy the pleasure of learning dancing together for the rest of your lives!  I have enjoyed teaching couples to move together as one on the dance floor beautifully since 1997.  I specialize in making the process easy and fun,  while maximizing the time that you have to create a wonderful dance that you can be proud to perform. Whether or not you have previous dance experience, or are both beginners with four left feet, in just a few lessons you can be moving and grooving across the dance floor, and already looking like accomplished dancers- I promise!  </p>

								The lessons that I teach are 50 minutes in length, and can be scheduled on the hour or half-hour, depending on previously scheduled lessons and availability. 

My fee is $80 per lesson, for 1 or 2 people, and I do offer a 5 lesson package for $375 ( 75 per lesson). Lessons for more than 2 people can be arranged for your own private group  ( for up to 10 people ) for the additional fee of $10 per person. Payment can be made by Venmo, PayPal, credit card, or check. It is not required to pay in advance, but only at the time of your lesson. 
							</p>
							<p class="align-left">
My teaching hours are usually Tuesday thru Friday 5pm-10pm, and Saturdays from 11am-5pm.  However, I am also available to teach from 11am-5pm during the weekdays if needed.

								My studio is located in downtown San Francisco, at 1067 Market st. ( near 7th) Suite #5005.  Civic center and City Hall is across the street, so there are numerous ways of arriving by public transportation, as well as street parking and garages 2-3 blocks away.

							<p class="align-left">Dance shoes are not required and any street shoes will do, as long as they are comfortable and wonâ€™t slip or fly off of your feet when you kick your heels up!

						<p class="align-left"> Eldon  Bryce has been a professional dance teacher, performer, and choreographer since 1997.  He first discovered his love of dance as a youth, learning the latest dance craze, breakdancing! After several years of entertaining others through dance, and theatre, he then discovered partner dancing, and found his reason for being. In January of 1997, he began his career at a Fred Astaire dance studio in Charlotte, North Carolina. He studied and taught all of the ballroom dances, and within 3 years he was presented with their highest award given to dance teachers. He moved to San Francisco in 2000, where he continued to study and compete in the Smooth and Latin dances, as well as focusing a lot on the Argentine Tango and Salsa. He also studied abroad in Buenos Aires with numerous Tango masters and legends. Eldon has received his national dance certifications from the FADS, USISTD, and DVIDA national dance organizations in the Ballroom, Latin, and also the Club style dances.  He has competed professionally in both Ballroom and Latin, but has always been most passionate about performing the Tango.  He feels the goal of a good dancer is to be able to understand ones role as a leader or follower, connect and listen to their partner, and move smoothly, comfortably, and in total unity with their partner, while expressing oneself to the music, and always keeping fun as number one!
						</p>
						<p class="align-left">
							Eldon has performed throughout his career with many of his students, and other professional teachers, in a variety of different stages, and on many types of dance floors. He choreographed and performed the musical dance show " Tango Del Cielo" for 7 years, and toured with the concert all over the country.  He was a featured dancer in the movie "Swing", and has choreographed and performed on MTV. He has starred in eight instructional dance DVDs, including the first ever "How to Become a Certified Dance Teacher." Eldon feels that anyone can learn to dance, and enjoys teaching everyone from beginning to expert. He especially loves choreographing for others to have a wonderful first dance, or to compete, or for any other reason to want to look great on the dance floor, and promises to make it fun and easy, too!
